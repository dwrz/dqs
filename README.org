* Interpreting the Output
A full portion is marked with a full-color background.

A half-portion colors the portion, but not the background.

Green is used to mark portions with positive points, yellow for zero points, red for negative points.

The total DQS is printed below the portion table output.

* Abbreviations
The following category name abbreviations may be used to add and remove portions.
